          <p>I began working as a web designer and front-end developer in Calgary, AB in 2011, where I worked in collaborative teams in an small web design firm, as well as independently as a freelancer.</p>
          <p>I focus on user centred design and usability and actively seek out learning opportunities to stay up to date with the latest trends and web standards. I enjoy tackling new challenges whether it's learning something new or skateboarding and hiking.</p>
